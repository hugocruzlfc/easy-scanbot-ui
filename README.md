# Add Scanbot SDK Web to Vite + React project

- This guide will help you to integrate the Scanbot SDK into a Vite + React project.

- Download the project and install the dependencies.

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

## Docs

- [Scanbot SDK documentation](https://docs.scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/web/introduction/)

## Important!

- The Scanbot SDK is a commercial product. The SDK license agreement can be found [here](https://scanbot.io/trial/). This project assumes that it already has a purchased and patented license.
- In this example we use "import.meta.env.VITE_SDK_LICENSE_KEY" for demonstration purposes. Remember that Vite will expose this variable in your html. Please use it safely in your project secrets.
